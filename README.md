# whitespace-php

Don't you hate programming in PHP? Me too! Well luckily, now you don't have
to!

Introducing whitespace! A dependently spaced language! Running inside of your
PHP interpreter!

Remember all of those discussions about tabs vs spaces? Never again!
Whitespace gives you both tabs **and** spaces! And newlines, too!

And guess what?! A lot of existing PHP programs are **already** valid
whitespace programs!

Now, I know what you're thinking. Does whitespace support indentation? The
answer is **yes**! Any character apart from newlines, tabs and spaces can be
used to indent your whitespace program!

Ok, but does it support comments? Well sure as hell it does! Any character
apart from newlines, tabs and spaces can be used to comment your program!
